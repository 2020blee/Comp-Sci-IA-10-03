First, click "Add an event" to begin adding important events.
Then, type in the name of your event and its date.
After a submission, you will be redirected to the list of all events.
You can add as many events as you want.

However, if you add /secret to the end of the URL, you will delete all events on the list.
Be careful when using this, as it is not reversible.
